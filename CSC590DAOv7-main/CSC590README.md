# Attribution:

Most of the code behind the functions and the CloneFactory in the CSC590DAOv7 are taken and/or refactored from the Molochv2.1 framework 
as expressed in the project's presentation and understood between group members and instructor. This is not meant to claim them as original
work as far as attribution is concerned. The purpose of the exercise is and always has been to write a DAO contract using a framework in
order to better understand the structure and function of DAO contracts. The deliverable of this project is a mini-DAO contract which is 
refactored largely from the framework listed in order to demonstrate understanding of the variable components of DAOs that enable their function. 
By including the FlatMolochFramework.sol and MolochREADME.md documents in this repo, the author's intention is to provide as much transparency
as possible in the inclusion and reliance on the Moloch framework utilized.
